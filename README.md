This document contains the code to reproduce the models fitting, the predictions and the figures of our manuscript "Decomposing biodiversity change to processes of extinction, colonization, and recurrence across scales" (DOI: 10.1111/ecog.06995). We modeled **1)** species richness, **2)** numbers and **3)** probabilities of extinction, colonization and recurrence. Models were fitted for the Atlas datasets (hereafter CzAtlas) on one hand and for the Czech Breeding Birds Survey on the other hand (hereafter CzBBS, or JPSP for Jednotný program sčítání ptáků) using repeated cross-validation with 3 different tree-based algorithms.

The data used (*i.e.* CzAtlas and CzBBS) are not open thus we provide them already processed into species richness, colonization, extinction... per unit of area. If you are interested in accessing the raw datasets (with species identities), feel free to contact the corresponding author.
