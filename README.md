This document contains the code to reproduce the models fitting, the predictions and the figures of our manuscript. We modeled **1)** species richness, **2)** numbers and **3)** probabilities of extinction, colonization and persistence. Models were fitted for the Atlas datasets (hereafter CzAtlas) on one hand and for the Czech Breeding Birds Survey on the other hand (hereafter CzBBS, or JPSP for Jednotný program sčítání ptáků) using repeated cross-validation with 3 different tree-based algorithms.

The data provided (*i.e.* CzAtlas and CzBBS) are already processed into species richness, colonization, extinction… per unit of area. If you are interested in accessing the raw datasets, feel free to contact the following email address: leroy@fzp.czu.cz.
